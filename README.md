# Stardew Valley Fish Analysis

## Overview
This was a project I made in RStudio during my first year of university in my Foundations of Data Science course. I found a Stardew Valley dataset on Kaggle, properly cleaned it, and then analyzed the data against some hypotheses I had at the beginning of the project. My project focuses on the economy surrounding the fishing minigame in Stardew Valley. I used graphs to interpret the cleaned data and answer my hypotheses.
